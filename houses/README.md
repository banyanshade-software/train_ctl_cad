# Houses / station / building for Z-scale model railway

Each directory contains a building for Z-scale (1:220) layout

They are intended to be built on 1mm thick paperboard using lasercut

Check for photos in each directory

Fusion360 file are not included, but I will add them on request

## maisonz
My very first building. A tiny nice house

## immeuble-z
Tiny again, as ground surface would be only 16 sq.m (4 x 4 meters) on prototype.
Inspired by a real building nearby (front face is nearly identical, 4m wide, but the real
building is obviously deeper)

## gare\_plm\_2class
Most ambitious project so far
PLM (Paris Lyon Méditéranée) was a french railway company from 1857 to 1937 (where all company were unified
in state owned SNCF). PLM built many station at the end of XIX century and after, all sharing the same
layout - with different addition for larger stations.
Orginal plan can be fetched here :
http://wikiplm.railsdautrefois.fr/wikiPLM/index.php?title=Gare\_voyageurs\_PLM\_duType\_2ème\_classe

(This building strictly follows the plan, but I was too lazy to add the chimney)

Because this kind of station had been built since 1870 and are still present in most city that were served by
PLM, it is suitable for almost any era

(Built is ongoing)

## poste\_aiguillage
a (not very realistic) yard tower. It is quite high (my layout has several level) 

## verriere
a single track depot for one locomotive, with a glass canopy

## small\_hangar
a small garage for one car (though front door is only 2.10m, could be a little narrow) 
convenient if there is some spare space when laser cutting

## station\_small\_toilets
again, convenient if there is some spare space when laser cutting
some small public toilets (though door is missing) - or some small guardhouse
