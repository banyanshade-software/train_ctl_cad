# ConnectTheDots for Autodesk Fusion 360

Have you ever imported a CAD file into autodesk fusion 360 only to discover that the imported lines and curves that make up the 2D bodies aren't fully connected? Autodesk fusion 360 can only generate 3D bodies from closed 2D sketch shapes. One can easily spend hours closing an imported 2D sketch by manually connecting all of the lines and curves. This can cause un-nessicary wrist strain and stress.

The ConnectTheDots Python script will take a selection of lines and curves and connect all of the end points that are within a very close threshold distance. This automagic will save you hours of work!
